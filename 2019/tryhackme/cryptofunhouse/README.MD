# CryptoFunHouse Solutions

Here are the solutions to a crypto-themed tutorial & challenge I made on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/cryptofunhouse).

You can try it by creating an account [here](https://tryhackme.com/signup), clicking "My Rooms" on the left, and entering "cryptofunhouse" in the room code box to the bottom left. Sections 1-3 give a steady tutorial into some basic cryptography concepts - Caesar ciphers, substitution ciphers, AES etc. Section 4 gives a tough CTF-style challenge based around cryptanalysis of AES.

### Sections 1-3

Python solutions for all questions are provided in the respective folders.

### Section 4

Python solutions, along with a full and detailed writeup, are provided in this folder.

Go program used to produce the challenge is also provided under *4_hard/go_program*.
